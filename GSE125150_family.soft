!Series_summary = Red blood cells (RBCs) mature within a specialized niche (the erythroblastic island (EI)), which consists of a central  macrophage surrounded by differentiating erythroblasts. Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell derived macrophages (iPSC-DMs) enhance proliferation and terminal maturation of Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) CD34+ derived erythroid cells and iPSC derived erythroid cells. These effects are further increased when an inducible KLF1-ERT2 fusion protein is activated in iPSC-DMs.  To assess the mechanism of action, we sought to compare the transcriptome of iPSC-DMs with and without KLF1 activation. For this, we used an inducible IPSC line (iKLF1.2) in which upon tamoxifen addition, the KLF1 transcription factor is translocated to nucleus and consequently KLF1 downstream targets are expressed. The identification and characterisation of could identify factors involved in erythroid maturation and thus helpful to improve current protocols to manufacture RBCs  in vitro.
!Series_overall_design = iKLF1.2 iPSCs were differentiated to macrophages and then split into 2 groups, one was treated with tamoxifen for the last 4 days of culture to activate KLF1. The other group was not treated with tamoxifen. Four biologically independent differentiation experiments were carried out and so 8 samples were generated: 4 samples of untreated iKLF1.2 iPSCs-derived macrophages and 4 samples of tamoxifen treated iKLF1.2 iPSC-derived macrophages. Total RNA was extracted from each sample and RNA integrity was of a high enough quality for library preparation, as all RIN values were above 9 for every sample.

IPSC Maintenance media was replaced with Day 0 mix:  StemPro hESC SFM (Gibco) supplemented with 50ng/ml BMP4 (R&D), 50ng/ml VEGF (R&D) and 20ng/ml SCF (Life Technologies). Colonies were cut using the EZPassageTM tool into two wells and cultured in Ultralow Attachment 6 well plates (Greiner) for four days to induce embryoid body (EB) formation. On day 2, cytokine top-up was carried out. On day 4, 10-15 EBs were transferred to one gelatin-coated well of a 6-well tissue culture grade plate containing 3ml Day 4 mix (X-VIVO15 media supplemented with 100ng/ml CSF1 (Biolegend), 25ng/ml IL-3 (Preprotech), 2mM Glutamax (Gibco), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 0.055mM β-mercaptoethanol. Media was changed every 3-4 days. After 3 weeks, the EBs started releasing non-adherent monocyte-like precursors that were harvested from the supernatant and plated into untreated bacteriological plates or six-well plates in Maturation mix (X-VIVO15 media supplemented with 100ng/ml CSF1, 2mM Glutamax and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin for 9-11 days.
